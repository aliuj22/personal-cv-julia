      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a 22 year old, based in Stockholm since 2018. Originally I'm from
        Poland. Currently studying my (not so long ago found) passion, Frontend
        Development at Hyper Island. I'm curious about the world and it's
        history, love reading books, which I buy more, than can read. Passionate
        about people and making positive changes to the world. I have experience
        in team leading, working in fast paced environment and under stressful
        conditions, due to having worked as an Assistant Manager in a popular
        restaurant. I enjoy working in teams as well as individually. I have
        skills in problem solving, organising and logistics. I speak fluent
        Polish and English, as well as Swedish on a basic, everyday level.
        During my time in Hyper Island I've been learning and gaining experience
        in html, css, javascript, ux and ui design, react, figma, GitHub and
        agile methods of working.
