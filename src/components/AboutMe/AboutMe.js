        I am a soon-to-be graduate from Hyper
        Island, eager to apply my skills and gain professional experience as a
        developer. <br />
        My experience as a Fullstack Development Intern at 12iD has allowed me
        to develop and implement new features and design on a demo website
        showcasing the 12iD mobile app. During my time there, I successfully
        completed a full redesign, implemented new flows and features, and
        gained a deep understanding of the product. I also worked on fixing bugs
        and adding new features to an in-production admin portal. <br /> My
        previous role as Assistant Manager at Greasy Spoon has honed my skills
        in problem-solving, team leadership, logistics and conflict resolution.
        I enjoy working in teams as well as individually. <br /> I speak fluent
        <b> Polish</b> and <b>English</b>, as well as Swedish on a basic,
        everyday level. <br /> During my time in Hyper Island and 12iD I've been
        learning and gaining experience in <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>,{' '}
        <b> JavaScript</b> and
        <b> TypeScript</b>,<b> UX</b> and <b>UI</b> design, <b>ReactJS</b>,{' '}
        <b>NextJS</b>, <b>Figma</b>, <b>git</b> and <b>GitHub</b>, <b>agile</b>{' '}
