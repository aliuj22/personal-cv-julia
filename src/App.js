      description: (
        <span>
          This is a project I mostly worked on during my internship at 12iD - a demo website for potential 12iD customers. Used to present different
          uses for the 12iD mobile app. My task was to implement a new design
          and to create more features. The goal was to not only update the
          design and make it more user-friendly but also to make the platform
          more versatile to attract a wide array of customers.
          <br /> Milestones: Complete redesign of existing features - based on
          the provided prototype from the designer. New features - activity log,
          front and backend logic for opening a savings account, updated and
          more straightforward payment flow, booking services and reporting an
          insurance claim, idle logout.
          <br /> Takeaways: Working in a small hybrid team, joining a big
          codebase, working with agile & kanban in a professional setting,
          progress reporting, typescript and redux, creating backend logic from
          scratch, code reviews and proper structure for PRâ€™s, thoroughly
          documenting my work and finally knowing when to ask for help.

The goal was to focus on working as a team following agile methodologies and learn how to successfully collaborate. My team and I had daily check-ins, code reviews, a weekly scrum master (a person in charge of making shure we follow scrum methodologies, a facilitator/coach) and sprint reviews. We mostly worked with pair and mob programming and implemented some TDD and basic encryption for the login function. My biggest learnings include working with MERN stack, NextJS, Mocha and Chai for backend testing, backend folder structure, mobile first design and working in sprints with a scrum master. `,
